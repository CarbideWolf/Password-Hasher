# Password Hasher
A lightweight program for hashing passwords (or really and string of text).

I wrote this program as a simple way of increasing password security. It takes your password and turns it into an alphanumeric string that is harder to crack through brute force attacks.

It was built using the GNU Crypto library and can output from any of the following algorithms:
- Haval
- MD2
- MD4
- MD5
- RipeMD128
- RipeMD160
- Tiger
- SHA160
- SHA256
- SHA384
- SHA512
- Whirlpool
